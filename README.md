## Installation and Usage  

Please look at [Top.GG](https://top.gg/bot/770312130037153813) for usage and installation

## Note
Bot is using charts from quickchart.io, images from countryflags.io and the FaceIT API v1 and v4.  
This is a rewrite of the old faceitbot. All commands are working but /save and the rolesystem needs more improvement  

## Known Bugs

/last 'player'  (ex. 99) could be too high for some players because player played unranked faceit games which cant be added to the equation (NOT fixable) -> use lower amount    
If you know a bug please create an issue or contact me on my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/DUuCMgXDJC)

## Can i host this bot by my own?
No please do not but I would love to see some pull requests
